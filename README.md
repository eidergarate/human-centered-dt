# human-centered-dt

## Description
The code in this repository implements a Digital Twin (DT) prototype designed for real-time support in a dynamic tire manufacturing environment. The DT focuses on:

 - Real-time extrusion quality monitoring

- Adaptive control through data-driven retraining

- Human-centered interfaces for decision support

This work is currently **under review** as a **Translational article** in *Data-Centric Engineering* (Cambridge University Press).

The project focuses on the deployment of a real-time, human-centered Digital Twin (DT) to support extrusion quality and decision-making in dynamic tire manufacturing processes. It emphasizes real-world implementation, adaptability, and usability for operators on the factory floor.

This repository includes the source code, ML components, and system interfaces supporting the case study presented in the manuscript.
